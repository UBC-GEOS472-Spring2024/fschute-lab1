# Exploratory Lab 1: Web Cartography

## Context and Justification:  
Being active for just 60 minutes a day carries a wide variety of benefits, including improved cognitive ability and productivity, and better immune function and cardiovascular health. In order to facilitate active lifestyles, it is important that each municipality offers quality, accessible recreation facilities. My map displays two datasets, both within the city of Longueuil, Quebec:
- six broad land use categories (residential, agriculture, greenspace, industrial, commercial, unlisted) colour coded according to the map legend 
- location of municipal recreation and sporting facilities (parks, playgrounds, arenas, public pools, gymnasiums, etc.) marked by black points

This map provides geographical context for the location and distribution of public recreational facilities. In order to reduce distractions, less important features such as place names and waterways were still included in order to orient the user and provide spatial context, but were given light, unobtrusive colours so that they would not interfere with the main map features (or create too much visual chaos). Roads on the other hand were given a darker, more bold colour in order to give the user a sense of relative density Completely unrelated map features such as transit routes and points of interest were removed. Based on a preliminary, visual analysis of the map, the user can determine that recreational facilities are often situated within relatively dense, residential regions, likely to improve accessibility for the greatest number of people. 

The colours for each land use category were chosen based on cartographic colour conventions (ex. green = parks and greenspace), and in order to clearly differentiate them from one another. Opacity was adjusted so that the user could see some of the city features (in order to orient the user and provide spatial context) and easily identify roadways, while still drawing their attention to the two main map layers. Recreational facilities were marked as black dots in order to make them immediately visible and to create contrast with land use districts. Creating this contrast allows the user to do a basic preliminary analysis on how the facilities are distributed (based on land use).     
   
This map was designed primarily for the general public. However, it could also be utilized for city planning purposes, providing context to current distribution patterns in order to inform the placement of others. Due to the basic 2D map view and the easily distinguishable layers, this map can be easily viewed and interpreted by anybody. I also chose current data (updated April 2024), in order to provide relevant, accurate information. The main goals of the map was to create a simple, efficient visualization to provide context on the spatial distribution of recreational and sporting facilities. Based on the cartographic decisions I made and visual elements that I employed, I believe that I have done so to the best of my ability. The map image attached below does a good job at illustrating those decisions, as well as the initial visualization of the distribution.    


## Reflection:      
If I were to recreate this map, there are a couple of additional layers that I would add. The distribution analysis can be furthered with the inclusion of information on city districts (population density, average income) as they are additional factors that could impact the facility distribution. That data would have to be added as text popups or as different layers that could be toggled on/off in order to make the map less chaotic and reduce visual traffic. This increased level of interactivity could also create a more substantial, informative, and engaging map experience.
